## Reproducible research

i When we say "reproducible research", we refer to the combination of computing environment and the project structure.

ii The computing environment is the hardware, operating system, and software that are used, such as Win10 and R. The project structure is the organization of the files and folders that make up the project.

iii It can help with tracking changes to local repository, such as revert to previous versions of files, create and edit parallel copies of files and then selectively integrate them and so on.

## Assessing

In this section I learned the basic of using github. I find it less frustrating comparing to the programming in previous lab, while I should keep the different process and their function in mind. I will continue to learn how to make the using of github into practial use.
